    <h1>My Dream Vacation: Cancun</h1>
    <p>I would love to go to Cancun. Here are some fun things I'd love to do at the resort!</p>
    <h2>Sit by the Beach</h2>
    <p>My favorite activity on vacation is sitting by a body of water and drinking cocktails. Bonus points if the cocktails are all-you-can-drink!</p>
    <h2>Swim in the Pool</h2>
    <p>If I can't sit by the beach, the pool is the second best thing! I love using a big floaty and also drinking cocktails.</p>
    <h2>Ziplining</h2>
    <p>After ziplining once in college, I really want to go again! I think it'd be so fun to zipline over a river or waterfall.</p>

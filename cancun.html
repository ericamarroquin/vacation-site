      <h1>My Dream Vacation: Cancun</h1>
      <p>I would love to go to Cancun. Here are some fun things I'd love to do at the resort and other things I've learned!</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Sit by the Beach</h2>
    <p>My favorite activity on vacation is sitting by a body of water and drinking cocktails. Bonus points if the cocktails are all-you-can-drink!</p>
    <h2>Swim in the Pool</h2>
    <p>If I can't sit by the beach, the pool is the second best thing! I love using a big floaty and also drinking cocktails.</p>
    <h2>Ziplining</h2>
    <p>After ziplining once in college, I really want to go again! I think it'd be so fun to zipline over a river or waterfall.</p>
    <h2>Why Cancun?</h2>
    <p>I've decided on Cancun because of the awesome things I've heard about it. My friends that have went absolutely loved it.</p>

     <p>There is a downside, to this trip, however. It is much more expensive than if you were to vacation somewhere in the United States. Resort costs, plus the airfare, can run you thousands of dollars.</p>
     <p class="bg-info">In total, the cost is around $6,000 USD for two people. Save wisely!</p>
